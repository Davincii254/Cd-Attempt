git clone https://github.com/your-username/toy-problem-challenges.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

- A > 79
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 49 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: Less than 40

#### Sample Code Snippet

```javascript
// Function to calculate the grade based on the mark
function calculateGrade(mark) {
    // Implement the logic here
}
```

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".

#### Sample Code Snippet

```javascript
// Function to check the speed and deduct points
function speedCheck(currentSpeed) {
    // Implement the logic here
}
```

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individualâ€™s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e., Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

#### Sample Code Snippet

```javascript
// Function to calculate net salary
function calculateNetSalary(basicSalary, benefits) {
    // Implement the logic here
}
```
